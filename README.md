# papi-mc

Embedded C code that controls the microcontroller (ESP32) for *codename* papi (Project Annotsav, Product Indra).


## Roadmap

- **pv0** - basic functions of an auto gardener

- **pv1** - redesign PCB to make a smaller package and include sensors and MC in the same unit (so that it could be inserted into farmland and just werk).

- **pv2** - p2p comms with other `pv1` units on the farmland. report to a central server near the farmland that decides the irrigation thingy.

- **pv3** - papi + urja. urja can provide power (a lot of it), and look like a scarecrow.

- **pv??** - generate enough electricity from soil / plants to self-sustain a unit.
